//Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i=0, high=nums.size()-1;
        int mid=0;
        while(i<=high)
        {
            if(nums[i]==0)
            {
                swap(nums[i], nums[mid]);
                mid++;
                i++;
            }
            else if(nums[i]==2)
            {
                swap(nums[i],nums[high]);
                high--;
            }
            else
                i++;
        }
          
    }
};
